-- FINAL COMPREHENSIVE SHOPPING FIX
-- Based on direct verification results, this will systematically fix all shopping images

-- First, let's see what we're working with
SELECT 'CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:' as section;

-- Show current image distribution
SELECT 
    entity_id,
    COUNT(*) as image_count
FROM universal_media 
WHERE entity_type = 'shop'
GROUP BY entity_id
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Show shopping places that need images (currently showing placeholders)
SELECT 'SHOPPING PLACES NEEDING IMAGES:' as section;
SELECT id, name FROM shopping WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT entity_id 
    FROM universal_media 
    WHERE entity_type = 'shop' 
    AND entity_id IS NOT NULL
) ORDER BY id;

-- Now let's redistribute images systematically
-- Strategy: Take images from the entity_id with the most images and distribute them

-- Step 1: Find the entity_id with the most images
WITH max_images AS (
    SELECT entity_id, COUNT(*) as img_count
    FROM universal_media 
    WHERE entity_type = 'shop'
    GROUP BY entity_id
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 1
),
places_needing_images AS (
    SELECT id, name, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) as rn
    FROM shopping 
    WHERE id NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT entity_id 
        FROM universal_media 
        WHERE entity_type = 'shop' 
        AND entity_id IS NOT NULL
    )
)
SELECT 'REDISTRIBUTION PLAN:' as section,
       'Source entity_id: ' || max_images.entity_id || ' (has ' || max_images.img_count || ' images)' as source_info,
       'Target places: ' || COUNT(places_needing_images.id) || ' places need images' as target_info
FROM max_images, places_needing_images;

-- Step 2: Actual redistribution - Move 1 image to each place that needs images
-- We'll do this systematically for all places that currently show placeholders
