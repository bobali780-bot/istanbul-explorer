        short_overview: 'Historic Ottoman spice market with aromatic Turkish delights and traditional goods',
        full_description: 'The Spice Bazaar (Mısır Çarşısı in Turkish) stands as Istanbul\'s second-largest covered bazaar and the world\'s biggest spice market, constructed in 1664 as part of the New Mosque complex. Originally funded by taxes from Ottoman Egypt, hence its name "Egyptian Bazaar," this architectural marvel showcases classic Ottoman design with its distinctive L-shaped layout covering 6,000 square meters. The bazaar houses 85 shops within high-domed ceilings adorned with intricate tilework, creating a feast for both the senses and eyes. Visitors experience an aromatic journey through 6 gates, discovering authentic Turkish spices including saffron, sumac, and baharat blends, alongside traditional Turkish delight (lokum) in flavors like rose, pistachio, and pomegranate. Beyond spices, the market offers premium teas, dried fruits, nuts, caviar, handmade ceramics, jewelry, and Turkish handicrafts. The bazaar operates daily from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM, making it accessible when the Grand Bazaar is closed on Sundays. Built by court architect Koca Kasım Ağa, the structure represents Ottoman commercial architecture at its finest, with revenues originally supporting the adjacent Yeni Camii mosque maintenance.',
