        full_description: 'A Bosphorus cruise offers the most spectacular way to experience Istanbul, sailing through the strait that connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara while separating Europe and Asia. This iconic waterway journey showcases over 20 centuries of history from a unique perspective. Major tour operators include Şehir Hatları (Istanbul\'s official ferry company), Turyol, and luxury yacht companies offering various experiences. The route typically starts from Eminönü or Kabataş and travels north past magnificent Ottoman palaces, Byzantine fortresses, and modern bridges. Key highlights include the opulent Dolmabahce Palace stretching along the European shore, the romantic Maiden\'s Tower on its tiny island, the imposing Rumeli Fortress built for the conquest of Constantinople, and the elegant Ortaköy Mosque beneath the Bosphorus Bridge. Tours range from budget-friendly 90-minute sightseeing trips (250 TL) to luxury dinner cruises with entertainment.
