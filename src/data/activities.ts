    shortOverview: "Visit the lavish 19th-century palace where Ottoman sultans lived in European-style luxury.",
    fullDescription: "DolmabahÃ§e Palace represents the final period of the Ottoman Empire, built in the mid-19th century as sultans sought to modernize and adopt European architectural styles. This opulent palace stretches 600 meters along the Bosphorus and features 285 rooms, 46 halls, and 6 baths, all decorated with a stunning mix of Baroque, Rococo, and Neoclassical styles. The palace is famous for its crystal chandeliers, including a 4.5-ton Bohemian crystal chandelier, gold leaf decorations, and priceless artworks. AtatÃ¼rk, the founder of modern Turkey, spent his final years here, and visitors can see his preserved quarters and the exact time of his death marked on all palace clocks.",
